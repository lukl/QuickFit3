To compile it I'd recommend git (Version Manager), MSYS2 (linux console plus minimal tools) and Qt Creator plus Qt 5.x .


- Install Git, MSYS2, QT (with some version of Qt 5.x) properly.

    Make sure not to have any spaces in the used installation paths (so c:/program files/.. won't not work)


- Clone Repo via Git (Recursive!!):

    Open git bash in the directory where QuickFit3 should end up. Then command:

    git clone --recursive -b rot-devel https://github.com/lukl/QuickFit3_rot/ <relative destination directory>


- MSYS2: Upgrade tools and install basic develompent tools

    Open MSYS2 console. Commands:

    pacman -Syuu

    pacman -S needed base_devel


- Compile dependency libraries for QF3.

    In MSYS2, go to QuickFit3lukl/extlibs

    Then type command:

    (sudo chmod +x build_dependencies.sh)

    ./build_dependencies.sh

    Some libs might not build, this is not always a problem.


- Rename or copy corresponding configuration template in QF Folder quickfit.inc.windows->quickfit.inc


- Open quickfit3.pro in qtcreator, configure and build.

    Open qt creator, open quickfit3.pro

    Click configure

    Then choose projects (left) ->choose build configuration: Release, untick Shadow build, QT5.x

    Build->Build all



Linux


- Install Git, QT, basic development tools

(In ubuntu 16.04, compilation required the following packages: qtscript5dev, libpng, pkg-config, libblas-dev, liblapack-dev, boost)

- Clone Repo via Git (Recursive!!) in terminal

    git clone --recursive -b rot-devel https://github.com/lukl/QuickFit3_rot/ QuickFit3lukl

- (sudo chmod +x build_dependencies.sh in extlibs)

- run extlibs/build_dependencies.sh (some might not build, this is not always a problem)

- Alter corresponding configuration template in QF Folder quickfit.inc.ubuntu->quickfit.inc, alter according to system configuration

- Configure quickfit3.pro in qtcreator (Choose Release, No Shadow build, QT5.x)

- Build all
