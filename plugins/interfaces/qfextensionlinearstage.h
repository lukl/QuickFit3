/*! \brief QuickFit QFExtension to control 1 axis (linear) motion stages
    \ingroup qf3extensionplugins

    Each of these plugins may control one stage with \f$ n \f$ axes. There are functions to move
    each axis separately and also read each axis's state. Configurations are edited by the user in a
    a dialog displayed with showSettingsDialog(). They are stored in calls to QFExtension::writeSettings()
    and read using QFExtension::readSettings().

    As this is useful some features common to many stages are implemented already in this class:
      - one may activate/deactivate a joystick for manual control: setJoystickActive()
    .

    There is one speciality about the connectDevice(), disconnectDevice() methods: For many stages there
    is only one controller which connects to several axes, so whenever connectDevice() for one axis is called
    the QFExtension using these stages should ask all other stages whether they are also connected, so you don't
    have to connect to each axis via a separate click. The same applies to the setJoystickActive() function.
    
        \note <b>Your implementation has to be thread-safe!!! So it can be called simultaneously from multiple threads, even when the invocations use shared data, because all references to the shared data are serialized</b>
